The project revolves around testing and ensuring the functionality of a web application called Idea Center . The primary objective is to validate that the application works as expected by creating test cases ,
identifying and documenting bugs , and performing API testing  using Postman. 
Key Components of the Project  
1. Software Requirements  

    Purpose : The Idea Center allows users to register, log in, manage their profiles, create ideas, and manage those ideas.
    Scope : The document focuses on basic functionalities for unregistered/non-logged users  and registered/logged users , excluding admin-specific features.
    System Environment : The application is accessible via a URL and supports two types of users:
        Unregistered Users : Can access the Home page, sign up, or log in.
        Registered Users : Can access additional features like profile editing, idea creation, and idea management.
         
     

2. Functionalities  

    Home Page : Displays a carousel with slides encouraging users to sign up or log in.
    Sign Up Page : Allows users to register with fields for username, email, password, and terms of service agreement. Supports alternative sign-up via Google or Facebook.
    Sign In Page : Enables registered users to log in using email and password.
    Profile Management : Logged-in users can edit their profile details (e.g., profile picture, first name, last name, city, and description).
    Idea Creation : Users can create ideas with a title, description, and optional image URL.
    Idea Management : Users can view, edit, or delete their created ideas and search for ideas using keywords.
     

3. Testing Tasks  

    Test Cases : Write at least 15 test cases  covering the 6 use cases:
        Accessing the Home Page.
        User Registration.
        User Sign-In.
        Profile Management.
        Idea Creation.
        Idea Management.
         
    Bug Reports : Identify and document at least 5 bugs  in the application.
    Documentation : Use the provided Test Management and Bug Tracker Template  to document all test cases and bugs.
     

4. API Testing  

    Endpoints :
        User-related endpoints: Create a user (POST /api/User/Create) and authenticate a user (POST /api/User/Authentication).
        Idea-related endpoints: List all ideas (GET /api/Idea/All), create an idea (POST /api/Idea/Create), edit an idea (PUT /api/Idea/Edit), and delete an idea (DELETE /api/Idea/Delete).
         
    Tasks :
        Log in to the API to obtain an access token.
        Perform API requests to create, list, edit, and delete ideas.
        Organize all API requests into a Postman collection  and export it as a JSON file.
         
     

5. Submission Requirements  

    Submit a .zip or .rar archive containing:
        The completed Test Management and Bug Tracker Template .
        The exported Postman collection  in JSON format.
         
     

Goals  

The project aims to ensure the Idea Center  application is functional, user-friendly, and bug-free by systematically testing its features and APIs. It also provides hands-on experience in manual testing,
bug reporting, and API testing using tools like Postman.

# Portfolio
Hello, my name is Georgi.

Since the end of 2024, I have been actively studying and practicing to become a QA professional. I am excited to have found a field where I can grow and contribute meaningfully.

With a Bachelor's degree in Biotechnology, I have developed a strong ability to follow structured protocols—an essential skill that naturally aligns with quality assurance. I see QA as an opportunity to enhance the digital experience for users, making it more seamless and accessible for everyone.

This portfolio showcases my knowledge of QA, along with the practical skills I have gained through courses, self-study, and my innate curiosity. I am committed to continuous learning and professional development. Currently, I am also delving into test automation, focusing on expanding my expertise and hands-on experience in this area including the usage of AI tools.

## My experience
With a solid foundation in biology and laboratory practices, I have developed strong attention to detail, problem-solving abilities, and experience in documenting and analyzing complex data. Throughout my career as a biologist, I was involved in rigorous research, experimenting, and adhering to strict protocols—skills that are directly transferable to the field of software quality assurance.

In my journey to becoming a Manual QA, I leveraged my scientific background to build a strong understanding of test processes, documentation, and data analysis. I transitioned my passion for identifying issues and ensuring quality into the tech industry, where I focus on testing software to ensure it functions as expected and meets user requirements.

By combining my analytical mindset with a keen eye for detail, I am now able to contribute effectively to QA teams, where I test applications, identify potential bugs, and provide clear documentation of test results to ensure the highest standards of software quality.

# Portfolio

Hello, my name is Georgi.

Since the end of 2024, I have been actively studying and practicing to become a Quality Assurance (QA) professional. I’m excited to have found a field where I can grow, contribute meaningfully, and help build better digital experiences.

With a Bachelor’s degree in Biotechnology, I’ve developed a strong ability to follow structured protocols—an essential skill that aligns naturally with quality assurance. I see QA as an opportunity to enhance software for users, making it more reliable, accessible, and intuitive.

This portfolio showcases my understanding of QA principles and the practical skills I've gained through coursework, self-study, and hands-on experimentation. Since August 2025, I’ve also been working as a freelancer, contributing to real-world projects that involve manual testing of web, mobile, and desktop applications, as well as API and unit test validation. I’m committed to continuous learning and professional growth. Currently, I’m also exploring test automation and experimenting with AI-powered tools to expand my testing capabilities and efficiency.

## My Experience

With a solid foundation in biology and laboratory practices, I’ve cultivated strong attention to detail, analytical thinking, and experience in documenting and interpreting complex data. Throughout my career as a biologist, I conducted rigorous experiments and adhered to strict procedural standards—skills that translate directly to software quality assurance.

As I transitioned into manual QA, I leveraged my scientific background to build a disciplined approach to testing, including writing clear test cases, executing structured test plans, and accurately reporting defects. Since August 2025, I’ve been applying these skills as a freelance QA tester, collaborating with clients on diverse projects that range from e-commerce platforms to fintech applications.

By combining an analytical mindset with a meticulous eye for detail, I contribute effectively to QA efforts—testing applications, uncovering bugs, and delivering clear, actionable documentation to support the delivery of high-quality software.

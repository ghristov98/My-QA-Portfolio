# Portfolio
Hello, my name is Georgi.

Since the end of 2024, I have been actively studying and practicing to become a QA professional. I am excited to have found a field where I can grow and contribute meaningfully.

With a Bachelor's degree in Biotechnology, I have developed a strong ability to follow structured protocolsâ€”an essential skill that naturally aligns with quality assurance. I see QA as an opportunity to enhance the digital experience for users, making it more seamless and accessible for everyone.

This portfolio showcases my knowledge of QA, along with the practical skills I have gained through courses, self-study, and my innate curiosity. I am committed to continuous learning and professional development. Currently, I am also delving into test automation, focusing on expanding my expertise and hands-on experience in this area.
